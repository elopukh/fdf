# fdf
This project helps to discover the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how to place points in space,
how to join them with segments and most importantly how to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.
This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments.
The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to my program.
All files are stored in flder called test_maps.
Each number corresponds to a point in space:<br/>
• The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.<br/>
• The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.<br/>
• The value corresponds to its altitude.<br/>
If you execute program fdf on this file **test_maps/t2.fdf** , we should see something like this

Press **C** and colours will change to gradient<br/>

Also there is other maps<br/>
